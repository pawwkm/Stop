A procedure is an executable chunk of code.

\subsection{Is Main}
If true the procedure is the entry point of the program; otherwise false. It is 
not required that an object file has a main procedure, but there cannot be more 
than one.

\subsection{Size of the Procedure}
This is the size of the code block following this number, in bytes. This is an
unsigned 32 bit integer.

\subsection{Code}
The actual code of the procedure.

\subsection{Number of References}
An unsigned 16 bit number telling how many references this procedure has to 
other atoms.

\subsection{References}
The references defines where the procedure refer to other atoms, the size of the 
address and if it the address is in little endian.

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Number of the Referenced Atom}
The number of an atom is the number of atoms declared before the referenced one.
This number is used instead of the name to save space and improve performance. 
This number is an unsigned 32 bit integer.

\subsubsection{Is it in Little Endian}
If true the address is in little endian; otherwise false.

\subsubsection{Address Type}
\begin{table}[h]

    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Name}    & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Description}                                          \\ \hline
        ArmTargetAddress & 0              & Encoded as defined in the Arm reference manual section A4.1.5 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Address}
This is the address within the code block of the procedure to relocate to match
the address of the referenced atom.
